# Supabase Deployment and Scaling Guide

This document provides guidance on deploying and scaling your Supabase-backed job application automation project.

---

## Deployment Considerations

- **Environment Variables:**
  - Ensure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are securely set in your deployment environment.
  - Use secrets management or environment variable configuration in your hosting platform.

- **Python Dependencies:**
  - Include `supabase` in your `requirements.txt`.
  - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.

- **Running the Application:**
  - Deploy your Python backend on a server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
  - Ensure network access to Supabase endpoints.

- **Docker Support:**
  - Create a Dockerfile to containerize your backend.
  - Pass environment variables securely to the container.

## Scaling Supabase

- Supabase is built on PostgreSQL and scales well for most applications.
- Monitor usage and upgrade your plan as needed.
- Use connection pooling to optimize database connections.
- Implement caching strategies if needed for read-heavy workloads.

---

## Security Best Practices

- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to restrict data access.
- Rotate API keys periodically.
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and authorization.
- Secure your backend API endpoints.

---

## Additional Integrations

- Consider integrating with:
  - Notion or Airtable for additional data views.
  - Google Sheets for reporting.
  - Notification services (email, Slack, Telegram) for alerts.

## Summary

This guide helps you deploy a secure, scalable, and maintainable backend using Supabase for your job application automation project.
